# TextField

The description of this program is create a Textfield with buttons that determines the horziontal allignment and column-size properties
dynamically, meaning that you can change it on the fly and the size/allignment will change depending on the values you choose and what allignment you want it to have.

## Analysis Steps

This section should restate the assignment and explain how you analyzed the requirements in order 
to develop a solution.

The assignment basically wants me to create an HBox that has radioButtons that designate the horizontal allignment and a column box that you can input a value into
to determine the size of a column that also changes the size and allignment dynamically, meaning in real-time, meaning you don't need to run the program over to see the effects.
I analzyed the requirements to develop a solution by simply just looking at the notes and overall descriptions of the pearson chapter and concluded that it would need buttons, HBox, Textfield and a vBox to display using a Stage. All the information is there for me to see and analzye what I exactly need.

### Design

No I just used one whole class for this program with a bunch of javaFX methods/objects. Buttons, Textfields HBoxes stood
out the most during the project and were very needed in order to make this program work. 

```
An Example of this would be Demo.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER_LEFT);
       Column.setAlignment(Pos.CENTER_RIGHT);
       Demo is allignment of the buttons and column is the alignment of the column box.
```

### Testing

A step by step series of examples that you developed to properly test the program. 

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Notes

No issues, the pearson notes helped me develop this program very easily
